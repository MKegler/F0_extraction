# Fundamental waveform (F0) extraction

Fundamental Frequency (and higher harmonics) waveform extraction from continuous speech using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). 
The code was used to obtained fundamental waveforms for modelling the auditory brainstem responses to continous speech in [1 - 4].

Method originally developed by A.E. Forte, O. Etard & T. Reichenbach in [1].

This repository contains maintained code, so please do feel free to report issues or suggest improvements.
